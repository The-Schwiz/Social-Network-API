# NoSQL: Social Network API

## Description

An API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. I used Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition I also used a JavaScript date library to format timestamps.

## User Story

```md
AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data
```

## Use

Download the code to your local repository, install all package dependencies with "npm i" in the CLI, then type "npm start" to start the server, then use insomnia or thunderclient to create data and test the endpoints.
